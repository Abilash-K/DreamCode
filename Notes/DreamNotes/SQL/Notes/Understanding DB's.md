## ***What is Data?***

[Data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data/) is statically raw and unprocessed information. ***For example*** – name, class, marks, etc. In computer language, a piece of information that can be translated into a form for efficient movement and processing is called data. Data is interchangeable information.

## ***What is a Database***?

A database is a collection of data that is organized, which is also called structured data. It can be accessed or stored in a computer system. It can be managed through a [Database Management System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-dbms-database-management-system-set-1/) (DBMS), a software used to manage data. Database refers to related data in a structured form.

***Application***: Company Information, Account information, manufacturing, banking, finance transactions, telecommunications.

## ***Types of Databases***

There are many types of databases.

- ****Relational Databases:**** A relational database’s contents are arranged as a collection of tables with rows and columns. Accessing structured data is made most flexible and efficient by relational database technology.

- ****Object-Oriented Databases:**** Similar to [object-oriented programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-object-oriented-programming/), data in an object-oriented database is represented as objects.

- ****Distributed Databases:**** A distributed database is made up of two or more files that are spread across multiple locations. The database could be dispersed across many networks, housed in one physical place, or kept on several computers.

- ****Data Warehouses:**** A data warehouse is a sort of database created especially for quick query and analysis. It is a central repository for data.

- ****NoSQL Databases:**** Unlike relational databases, which specify how all data input must be formatted, NoSQL, or nonrelational databases, permit the storing and manipulation of unstructured and semistructured data. The prevalence and complexity of online applications led to the rise in popularity of NoSQL databases.

- ****Graph Databases:**** Data is stored in a graph database using entities and their relationships.

- ****OLTP Database:**** An [OLTP database](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/on-line-transaction-processing-oltp-system-in-dbms/) is a quick, analytical database made to handle lots of transactions from several users at once.

- ****Open source databases:**** A database system that is open source can have either a [SQL or NoSQL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-sql-and-nosql/) database as its source code.

- ****Cloud databases:**** A collection of organized or unorganized data that is housed on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform is known as a cloud database. Cloud database models come in two flavors: traditional and [database as a service (DBaaS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-database-as-a-service/). With DBaaS, a service provider handles maintenance and administrative duties.

## ***What is DBMS? and types of DBMS**

A [Database Management System (DBMS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-dbms-database-management-system-set-1/) is software designed to store, organize, and manage data efficiently. It consists of two key components:

- The ****database**** is a collection of interconnected data.
- The ****management system**** ensures proper handling of data.

DBMS uses a technique called normalization to minimize redundancy by splitting large tables into smaller, more efficient ones. Compared to traditional file systems, DBMS offers greater flexibility and more advanced backup mechanisms. DBMS systems are categorized based on data models, distribution, or user numbers. Common types include relational, distributed, hierarchical, object-oriented, and network DBMS. A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships within the database.

****DBMS can be classified into two main types:****

1. Relational Database Management System [(RDBMS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rdbms-full-form/)
2. 1. Non-Relational Database Management System [(NoSQL or Non-SQL)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-nosql/)
